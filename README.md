## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- FlexBox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- LocalStorage
- [MVC: Model-View-Controller](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC)

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I applied some of the concepts I've been studying, such as array methods and how to store and retrieve data from Local Storage. Furthermore, I used the Event Delegation pattern to handle the different buttons and the MVC pattern to a better division of the UI and the data store logic. Besides this, I learned how to implement the drag/drop functionality to reorder the list.

### Continued development

This project was an outstanding opportunity to apply and learn a lot of concepts. In future projects, I want to focus more on different software design patterns like the MVC since it helped me better organize the scripts. Moreover, I plan to refactor this project to use IndexDB instead of LocalStorage because it better suits the purpose of a To-Do app.
